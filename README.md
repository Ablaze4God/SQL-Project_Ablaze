## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
1. While loading the csv files into the database ecommerce, I was able to identify primary key and load the tables using the different data types for the sales_report, sales_by_sku and products CSV files. I had difficulty with loading the remaining 2 CSV files (all_sessions and analytics) and couldn't identify a primary key at the time of loading the CSV into the database. Those two tables would need substantial data cleaning.

## Future Goals
