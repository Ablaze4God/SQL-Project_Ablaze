Some key risk areas for QA

1. Data Integrity Issues:


2. Incorrect Data Types: Ensuring that data types used in columns are appropriate for the data they will store, and preventing unintended conversions or truncations.

3. Data Accuracy and Validity: Verifying that data entries are valid and accurate according to defined business rules.
Data Security and Privacy:


4. Data Consistency:Ensuring that data updates or inserts do not lead to inconsistent or conflicting information in the database.

5. Data Migration and ETL Processes:

Data Loss or Corruption: Ensuring that data is accurately transformed and loaded during ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Backups: Ensuring that appropriate backup and recovery procedures are in place to prevent data loss in case of failures or disasters.
